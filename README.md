# face-vertification
This is a simple face vertification task. The ORL face database concludes 10 different images of 40 distinct subjects. A Siamese network is used to determine the similarity. For loss function, a contrastive loss is defined(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/hadsell-chopra-lecun-06.pdf).
